# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-ANN
This project predicts bank customer churn using an ANN. The dataset is preprocessed using label encoding (Gender) and one-hot encoding (Geography). After splitting the data, the ANN is trained and evaluated using a confusion matrix, achieving 86% accuracy. The model helps identify customers likely to leave the bank.
